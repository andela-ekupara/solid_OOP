/*
Consider an insurance system that validates health insurance claims before
approving one. We can follow the complementary Single Responsibility Principle
to model this requirement by creating two separate classes.
A HealthInsuranceSurveyor class responsible to validate claims and a
ClaimApprovalManager class responsible to approve claims.*/

/* Both the HealthInsuranceSurveyor and ClaimApprovalManager classes work fine
and the design for the insurance system appears perfect until a new requirement
to process vehicle insurance claims arises. We now need to include a new
VehicleInsuranceSurveyor class, and this should not create any problems.

vehicle insurance claims. This is how the modified ClaimApprovalManager will be:

  }
}

/* In the example above, we modified the ClaimApprovalManager class by adding a
new processVehicleClaim() method to incorporate a new functionality
(claim approval of vehicle insurance).
o conform to the OC principle, letâ€™s introduce a layer of abstraction by
creating an abstract class to represent different claim validation behaviors.*/

public abstract class InsuranceSurveyor {
  public abstract boolean isValidClaim();
}

// and then write the specific classes for each type of claim validation.

public class HealthInsuranceSurveyor extends InsuranceSurveyor{

 /* In the example above, we wrote a processClaim() method to accept a
 InsuranceSurveyor type instead of specifying a concrete type.

 will not affect the ClaimApprovalManager class.*/
